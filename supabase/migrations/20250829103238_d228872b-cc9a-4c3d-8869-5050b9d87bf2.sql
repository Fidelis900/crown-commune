-- This will resolve the persistent captcha verification failures

-- Note: The actual captcha settings are controlled in the Supabase dashboard
-- but we can ensure any captcha-related database constraints are removed

-- Remove the capCHAT secret if it exists (it's causing issues)
-- This is handled via the dashboard, but we document it here
